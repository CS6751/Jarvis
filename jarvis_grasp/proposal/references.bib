abstract={Having a representation of the capabilities of a robot is helpful when online queries, such as solving the inverse kinematics (IK) problem for grasping tasks, must be processed efficiently in the real world. When workspace representations, e.g. the reachability of an arm, are considered, additional quality information such as manipulability or self-distance can be employed to enrich the spatial data. In this work we present an approach of inverting such precomputed reachability representations in order to generate suitable robot base positions for grasping. Compared to existing works, our approach is able to generate a distribution in SE(2), the cross-space consisting of 2D position and 1D orientation, that describes potential robot base poses together with a quality index. We show how this distribution can be queried quickly in order to find oriented base poses from which a target grasping pose is reachable without collisions. The approach is evaluated in simulation using the humanoid robot ARMAR-III [1] and an extension is presented that allows to find suitable base poses for trajectory execution.},

abstract={The ability of computing a quality index for given configurations can be useful for several applications in the context of robotic manipulation. E.g. it can be used for monitoring the current state of the system or it can support decision processes, such as grasp selection in humanoid robotics. Here, a large set of precomputed grasps for a given object have to be quickly filtered in order to select the reachable sub set, for which the inverse kinematics (IK) problem has to be solved. In this work, we present an approach for analyzing the workspace capabilities of a manipulator in order to store a representation for efficient online processing. Compared to existing work, where usually reachability information is used to represent the robot's capabilities, we show how an extended manipulability measure can be used to build a quality distribution in workspace. The proposed approach for manipulability measurement is suitable for redundant manipulators while considering joint limits and self-distance. Further, task specific distributions are introduced and several applications for the humanoid robots ARMAR-III [1] and iCub [2] are presented.},

               This paper discusses the manipulating ability of robotic mechanisms in positioning and orienting end-effectors and proposes a measure of manipulability. Some properties of this measure are obtained, the best postures of various types of manipulators are given, and a four-degree-of-freedom finger is considered from the viewpoint of the measure. The pos tures somewhat resemble those of human arms and fingers.

pages={1108-1113}, 
abstract={This paper discusses two ways to estimate the interaction force at the end-effector of a robot. The first approach that is presented combines filtered dynamic equations with a recursive least squares estimation algorithm to provide a smoothened force signal, which is useful in the (common) case of noisy torque measurements. The second approach, which uses a generalized momentum based disturbance observer, is mainly discussed to compare it to the first approach. Although very different in appearance, it is shown that a close connection exists between both approaches. Simulation results for both algorithms are shown, and experimental results derived from a sensorless admittance controller that was implemented using the algorithms are presented.},
